# Linear Transformations and Inverse Transformations in Python

This repository contains solutions for an assignment on linear and affine transformations in computational linear algebra. The task involves applying and visualizing transformations such as scaling, rotation, shearing, translation, and their inverses using Python and `matplotlib`.

## Assignment Details

The assignment focuses on understanding and implementing:
1. **Linear Transformations**:
   - Scaling
   - Rotation
   - Shearing
2. **Affine Transformations**:
   - Translation
3. **Sequences of Transformations**:
   - Applying multiple transformations in order (e.g., scale → rotate → shear).
4. **Inverse Transformations**:
   - Undoing transformations to recover the original shape.

## Problem Overview

### Problem 1.1: Single Transformations
- Apply individual transformations (e.g., scaling, rotation, translation, and shearing) to a base "M" shape defined by a set of 2D points.
- Visualize the transformed shapes alongside the original shape.

### Problem 1.2: Sequences of Transformations
- Apply multiple transformations in sequence (e.g., scale followed by rotation).
- Visualize the combined effect of the transformations.

### Problem 1.3: Inverse Transformations
- Compute the inverse transformation matrix for a given sequence of transformations.
- Apply the inverse matrix to recover the original shape.
